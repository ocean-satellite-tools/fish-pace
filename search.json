    "text": "How does it impact Aquaculture/Fisheries?\nSome fisheries applications may prefer to work in units of carbon biomass instead of pigment- based (i.e. chlorophyll-a) biomass. A constant chlorophyll-a value can represent a wide array of cell concentrations, due to environmental conditions and individual cell physiology/stress. For example, individual phytoplankton can produce more chlorophyll-a/cell in low-light conditions without changing the actual number of cells. The carbon product is not subject to these variations, and is a more direct indicator of phytoplankton biomass. Modelers may also be interested in computing the carbon to chlorophyll ratio, which can be obtained as carbon_phyto/chlor_a.",

    "text": "The ocean is a relatively dark target as viewed from space, making up only 4-10% of the light signal seen from a satellite’s perspective above the atmospheric layers. As such, ocean color satellite sensors need to be very sensitive in order to collect a usable signal, but not so sensitive that the radiance (light) signal saturates the optics. There are various trade-offs to consider when designing a satellite, and these impact the potential usability of data products. Different satellite missions may exhibit variations in the spatial resolution (size of the ‘pixel’), temporal resolution (how often a satellite passes the same area), and spectral resolution (how many discrete colors are sampled), making some satellites better suited for certain applications over others. A satellite with relatively high spatial resolution (e.g. Landsat - 30 meter pixels) would be useful to resolve very near-shore, estuarine, and freshwater environments, but as these satellites have to zoom in closer, it takes longer periods of time to revisit the same location (up to 16 days), so the applications may be best suited for e.g. habitat characterization. A satellite with a larger spatial footprint (e.g. MODIS, PACE - 1 km pixels) can cover the entire globe daily, and be used for more operational purposes, but will not sufficiently resolve small-scale ocean features or many lakes. Sometimes a pair or constellation of sensors can be combined to help increase revisit time and increase spatial resolution (e.g. Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B OLCI sensors – 300 meter pixels, 2-3 day revisit time). In the future, NOAA (GeoXO – launching 2032) and NASA (GLIMR – launching ~2028) plan to launch geostationary satellites, which can ‘stare’ at locations longer, and revisit a location multiple times per day, creating a sequence of images to mitigate cloud cover, as well as examine biological rates, fluxes, particle trajectories, and more. The tradeoff with a geostationary orbit is that it can only view a particular portion of the globe over a mission lifetime. The table below provides a quick user guide to a several relevant ocean color platforms (past, present, and future), and their specifications. For long-term consistent time series (1997 – present), the current recommendation is to utilize the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) dataset, which merges multiple satellite data records and bias corrects sensor differences. This dataset is updated quarterly, and does not yet provide a near real time product.",

However there are many other ways to access ocean color data.\nNOAA provides a value added service known as CoastWatch that serves up satellite data, user tools, a Graphical User Interface data viewing portal, data analyses software, in addition to training modules, and more. You can also opt to use NOAA’s ERDDAP data server, which gives you a simple, consistent way to download subsets of scientific datasets (Level 3 and above) in common file formats and make graphs and maps on the spot. Here, you can specify a square set of coordinates and derive time-series data, or make maps of data products within your browser, and export the results in a custom format. ERDDAP is useful for integrating with programming languages for automated downloads and more advanced analyses. The aforementioned OC-CCI dataset can also be found through NOAA’s ERDDAP, but some missions (such as MODIS or SeaWiFS) are not included. NASA’s OBDAAC does archive all the datasets listed in Table 1 (except Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel-2 data, which is accessible through the USGS EarthExplorer tool), and may be accessed through a browser tool. NASA also provides a Graphical User Interface data analysis tool called SeaDAS, which enables data processing from L0 – L4, and data visualization/analysis. More heavy data processing can be performed and automated at the command line using the OCSSW system. The active Earthdata forum can help you with any issues you have, from installation to data processing. Sometimes, you may just want to browse through data products quickly, in which case, the most user friendly mechanism is through NOAA STAR’s OCView. Scroll through daily or averaged global files with a click of a button, and toggle a range of options (e.g. true color, ocean color, temporally averaged files, anomalies, L2 granule locations and name, and more). NASA’s Giovanni and Copernicus’ MyOcean viewer also offer different flavors of similar capabilities, each with strengths and weaknesses."

    "text": "The sun emits electromagnetic radiation that hits the Earth, and all of life on this planet depends on just a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - the colors of the rainbow (‘visible’ light). These are the specific wavelengths (400 -700 nm) by which plants on Earth photosynthesize and give us oxygen that we breathe. As this visible light hits the surface of the ocean and goes into the water, only one of two things can happen to that light - the light can either be scattered, or it can be absorbed by various constituents in the seawater. Pure water naturally absorbs more red light, leaving blue light to be scattered back to our eyes, and it is why the deep ocean appears blue. Conversely, other materials in the water – algae, dissolved organic material, dying or dead plant cells, floating seaweed, pollutants, suspended sediments from land, among other things - each uniquely absorb different amounts and types (wavelengths) of light, creating a color palette that we sense from discrete measurements of light from satellite sensors (Figure 1). How well we unravel the ocean composition from this signal largely depends on how well we can see these colors. Our heritage ocean color satellites detect anywhere from 5-10 wavelengths, which has limited our ability to distinguish some components from others. The launch of the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission on February 8, 2024 introduced the satellite community to global ‘Hyper’-spectral measurements, meaning a spectrally continuous sampling of light. This has afforded the opportunity to sense the ocean through an entirely new lens by being able to resolve previously undetectable, subtle features unique to e.g. a particular phytoplankton class, or other ocean constituents. NOAA will be codifying these hyperspectral ocean color capabilities well into the 2050s with the launch of GeoXO, which will offer an even newer perspective from a geostationary orbit, where we can revisit the same area several times per day. This document is intended to familiarize readers with the capabilities and nuances of available and emergent ocean color data products to help guide use and implementation plans in NMFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The 5 panels (right) display the spectrum of light corresponding to the ocean color shown.

Having more information about the other components of the water will help separate the living from non-living components, and will improve the performance chlorophyll-a product substantially. Some efforts at improving chlorophyll-a have been attempted using regional tuning methods, generalized additive models, or applying machine learning techniques, but lack official community endorsement. Currently, NOAA/NASA are working on a dynamic tuning factor to make chlorophyll-a applicable across all water types and regions.

Scalar irradiance is derived by taking the sum of light from all angles onto a point on the ocean - how much light is hitting the ocean. Planar irradiance scalesthe amount of light based on the cosine of the direction it comes from, and likely won’t be used for fisheries/aquaculture applications. There are above water products (how much hits the surface), and below water product which take into account the index of refraction as you cross the surface of the ocean’s water (i.e. how much of that is actually getting to the contents of the water). In most cases, user would likely want to use the par_day_scalar_below product.",

While not the most significant factor, one study showed that PAR contributed to variability in Catch per Unit Effort more than SST and fishing hour.",
