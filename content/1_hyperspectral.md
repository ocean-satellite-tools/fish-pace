Our heritage ocean color satellites detect anywhere from 5-10 wavelengths, which has
limited our ability to distinguish some components from others. The launch of the Plankton, Aerosol,
Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission on February 8, 2024 introduced the satellite community to
global hyperspectral measurements, meaning a spectrally continuous sampling of light (right panels @fig-1intro). This has
afforded the opportunity to sense the ocean through an entirely new lens by being able to resolve
previously undetectable, subtle features unique to e.g. a particular phytoplankton class, or other ocean
constituents. NOAA will be expanding these hyperspectral ocean color capabilities well into the 2050s with
the launch of GeoXO, which will offer an even newer perspective from a geostationary orbit, where we
can revisit the same area several times per day.

What can we do with ocean color information? The widely used Chlorophyll-a estimates derived from remote-sensing data come from ocean color measurements. The estimates come from algorithms based on ratios of the intensity of reflected or absorbed light in different color bands which were derived from many studies of ocean color along with in-situ measurements of Chlorophyll-a. But this is just one or many products that we can derive from ocean color data. The [Hyperspectral products](1_hyperspectral.html) section will familiarize you with the capabilities and nuances of available and emergent ocean color data products.

![The 5 panels (right) display the spectrum of light corresponding to the ocean color shown. On the y-axis is the light spectrum (frequency) and the x-axis is the light intensity. Each location denoted by the red squares has a unique spectral fingerprint (shape of the intensity at each spectrum) which is imparted by the
materials in the water.](../images/pace-fish-figure-1.png){#fig-1intro}
