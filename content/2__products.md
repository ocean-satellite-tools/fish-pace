Ocean color sensors provide core information on

* What is the color of the ocean? (Rrs)
* How much light is there? (PAR/Kd)

From these core measurements, we can compute other derived products, which help us understand the biological organisms in the water:

* What/who is there? (phytoplankton composition, SPM)
* How much of it is there? (chlorophyll concentration, particulate/phytoplankton carbon)
* Are they shiny or colorful? (IOPs)
* What are they doing? (Primary productivity)
* How are they doing? (Fluorescence Line Height)

The next pages will go into more detail on each of these.
