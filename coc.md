title: Code of Conduct
---

The ITCOocean Hack2week is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate either in-person or virtual form, including the Discussion boards and Slack workspace. Participants (including event volunteers and organizers) violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.

## Definition of Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Expectations

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

The organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the event venues and event-related social activities.


## Reporting a violation

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of the event for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.

If you feel comfortable contacting someone associated with our event, you may speak with one of the event organizers in person or contact an organizer on a private Slack channel.
