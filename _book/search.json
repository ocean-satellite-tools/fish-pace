    "text": "The sun emits electromagnetic radiation that hits the Earth, and all of life on this planet depends on just a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - the colors of the rainbow (‘visible’ light). These are the specific wavelengths (400 -700 nm) by which plants on Earth photosynthesize and give us oxygen that we breathe. As this visible light hits the surface of the ocean and goes into the water, only one of two things can happen to that light - the light can either be scattered, or it can be absorbed by various constituents in the seawater. Pure water naturally absorbs more red light, leaving blue light to be scattered back to our eyes, and it is why the deep ocean appears blue. Conversely, other materials in the water – algae, dissolved organic material, dying or dead plant cells, floating seaweed, pollutants, suspended sediments from land, among other things - each uniquely absorb different amounts and types (wavelengths) of light, creating a color palette that we sense from discrete measurements of light from satellite sensors.",

    "text": "Our heritage ocean color satellites detect anywhere from 5-10 wavelengths, which has limited our ability to distinguish some components from others. The launch of the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission on February 8, 2024 introduced the satellite community to global hyperspectral measurements, meaning a spectrally continuous sampling of light (right panels Figure 3.1). This has afforded the opportunity to sense the ocean through an entirely new lens by being able to resolve previously undetectable, subtle features unique to e.g. a particular phytoplankton class, or other ocean constituents. NOAA will be expanding these hyperspectral ocean color capabilities well into the 2050s with the launch of GeoXO, which will offer an even newer perspective from a geostationary orbit, where we can revisit the same area several times per day.\nWhat can we do with ocean color information? The widely used Chlorophyll-a estimates derived from remote-sensing data come from ocean color measurements. The estimates come from algorithms based on ratios of the intensity of reflected or absorbed light in different color bands which were derived from many studies of ocean color along with in-situ measurements of Chlorophyll-a. But this is just one or many products that we can derive from ocean color data. The Hyperspectral products section will familiarize you with the capabilities and nuances of available and emergent ocean color data products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The 5 panels (right) display the spectrum of light corresponding to the ocean color shown. On the y-axis is the light spectrum (frequency) and the x-axis is the light intensity. Each location denoted by the red squares has a unique spectral fingerprint (shape of the intensity at each spectrum) which is imparted by the materials in the water.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The ocean is a relatively dark target as viewed from space, making up only 4-10% of the light signal seen from a satellite’s perspective above the atmospheric layers. As such, ocean color satellite sensors need to be very sensitive in order to collect a usable signal, but not so sensitive that the radiance (light) signal saturates the optics. There are various trade-offs to consider when designing a satellite, and these impact the potential usability of data products. Different satellite missions may exhibit variations in the spatial resolution (size of the ‘pixel’), temporal resolution (how often a satellite passes the same area), and spectral resolution (how many discrete colors are sampled), making some satellites better suited for certain applications over others. A satellite with relatively high spatial resolution (e.g. Landsat - 30 meter pixels) would be useful to resolve very near-shore, estuarine, and freshwater environments, but as these satellites have to zoom in closer, it takes longer periods of time to revisit the same location (up to 16 days), so the applications may be best suited for e.g. habitat characterization. A satellite with a larger spatial footprint (e.g. MODIS, PACE - 1 km pixels) can cover the entire globe daily, and be used for more operational purposes, but will not sufficiently resolve small-scale ocean features or many lakes. Sometimes a pair or constellation of sensors can be combined to help increase revisit time and increase spatial resolution (e.g. Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B OLCI sensors – 300 meter pixels, 2-3 day revisit time). In the future, NOAA (GeoXO – launching 2032) and NASA (GLIMR – launching ~2028) plan to launch geostationary satellites, which can ‘stare’ at locations longer, and revisit a location multiple times per day, creating a sequence of images to mitigate cloud cover, as well as examine biological rates, fluxes, particle trajectories, and more. The tradeoff with a geostationary orbit is that it can only view a particular portion of the globe over a mission lifetime. The table below provides a quick user guide to a several relevant ocean color platforms (past, present, and future), and their specifications. For long-term consistent time series (1997 – present), the current recommendation is to utilize the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) dataset, which merges multiple satellite data records and bias corrects sensor differences. This dataset is updated quarterly, and does not yet provide a near real time product.",

For example, individual phytoplankton can produce more chlorophyll- a/cell in low-light conditions without changing the actual number of cells.
